Training a chatbot for context recognition
The goal of this project is to build a chatbot which recognises and conveys the context through which the user is interacting.

A Dialogflow agent is similar to a human call center agent. You train them both to handle expected conversation scenarios, and your training does not need to be overly explicit.
An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn. For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can handle a complete conversation.
Here in this chatbot being built, the intents for various user interactions are deducted and coded accordingly.

This entire project is built on Dialogflow, integrated with HTML web page and then deployed on Netlify cloud platform.
