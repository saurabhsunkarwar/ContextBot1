Training a chatbot for context recognition
The goal of this project is to build a chatbot which recognises and conveys the context through which the user is interacting.

A Dialogflow agent is similar to a human call center agent. You train them both to handle expected conversation scenarios, and your training does not need to be overly explicit.
An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn. For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can handle a complete conversation.
Here in this chatbot being built, the intents for various user interactions are deducted and coded accordingly.
